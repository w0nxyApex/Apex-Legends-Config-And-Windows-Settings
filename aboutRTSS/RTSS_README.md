## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Display real-time information such as FPS, CPU/GPU usage, temperatures, and more.
- **FPS Limiting**: Cap your frame rates to reduce screen tearing and improve system stability.
- **Customizable Overlays**: Create and customize overlays to display the statistics you need.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with MSI Afterburner and other hardware monitoring tools.

## Why Use RTSS for FPS Limiting?
1. **Reduce Screen Tearing**: By capping the FPS to your monitor's refresh rate, you can minimize screen tearing without the need for V-Sync.
2. **Improve System Stability**: Limiting FPS can help in reducing unnecessary GPU workload, leading to lower temperatures and potentially extending hardware lifespan.
3. **Consistent Performance**: Provides a more stable and consistent gaming experience by preventing FPS spikes and drops.
4. **Lower Power Consumption**: Reducing the FPS can also help in decreasing the power consumption of your GPU, leading to a more energy-efficient system.

## For example 

    Here you see the Frames capped by the game at 180 FPS, Here you see, constantly fluctuating fps.

    And here FPS capped with RTSS, a quiet, consistently high fps number. But you can only do this if you set an FPS limit in the range that your computer can produce without fluctuations.
